:code:`stark`
-------------------

Spectral exTraction And Reduction Kit, or :code:`stark`, is written with the aim to provide a 
general purpose tool for optimal extraction of spectrum from the raw (or, reduced) data. Although the 
current version is mainly written and tested with the spectral timeseries data from JWST, it will work quite
well with the spectral extraction from any dataset. See, the tutorials below to explore the capabilities of :code:`stark`.

:code:`stark` is under an active developement in a public repository at `GitHub <https://github.com/Jayshil/stark>`_.
Feel free to open an issue there if there is any bug in the package, or if you want to request a feature.

Contributions
==================


The current version of the original code is developed by `Jayshil A. Patel <https://github.com/Jayshil>`_ 
with keeping in mind analysis of spectroscopic timeseries for example from the *James Webb Space Telescope*. 
The concept of the code was originally developed by `Alexis Brandeker <https://github.com/alphapsa>`_ and initial versions are 
implemented by Marcus Karlsson and Erwan Taillanter. Later, the code was adapted to process UVES 
data by `Gayathri Viswanath <https://github.com/gayaviswa>`_ and Maria Cavallius with valuable contributions from Markus Janson.

We love contributions! :code:`stark` is open source, built on open source, and we'd love to have you 
hang out in our community. Feel free to make a *fork* and open a *pull request* to the *dev* branch of 
the code on GitHub.
