## [0.4.1] - 2024-02-11

### Added

- `univariate_psf_frame`, `univariate_multi_psf_frame` and `bivariate_psf_frame` functions now also return the updated mask table -- the updates being including those points which were identified by sigma clipping performed while fitting 1D/2D splines.
- Added a function `table2frame` in `SingleOrderPSF` class to convert back 2D frames from 1D pixel table generated by `norm_flux_coo`.

## [0.4.0]

### Changed

- Row-by-row and column-by-column background subtraction function now also return the subtracted background.

### Added

- Functions to perform polynomial background subtraction along rows and columns.
- Function to perform a 2D background subtraction.

## [0.3.0]

### Changed

- Created a class for extracting psf frame for single order spectral data. This clss combines `flux_coo`, `norm_flux_coo`, `univariate_psf_frame` and `bivariate_psf_frame` functions.
- Changed the name of `psf_extract` to `optimal_extract` to avoid confusion.
- Updated docstrings
- Removed "oversample" in y (column) direction.

### Added

- Function to produce PSF using multi-column 1d spline fitting in `SingelOrderPSF` class.
- Functions to trace the spectrum in the data in `reduce.py`.

## [0.2.0] - 2023-02-24

### Added

- Added function to perform background subtraction.
- Created `reduce.py`
- Function to generate PSF frame using bivariate spline fitting to the whole dataset.
- Function to extract spectrum by fitting psf frame to the data.
- Function to generate psf frame using univariate spline fitting to the whole dataset.
- Functions to build a pixel array list and its normalized version.
- Univariate and bivariate spline fitting functions

## [0.1.0] - 2023-02-10

### Added

- Aperture extraction function in `extract.py`.
- CHANGELOG.md created
